#Freedom and shit - A Manifesto

1)We are all human beings. A.K.A. the queen poops too.
2)We are many and all different. Everyone of us has qualities that can share with everyone. A.K.A. strength is in numbers.
3)We live on this planet, with enough resources for everyone, if used in an equal and responsible way. We have the technical and scientific knowledgee to radically modify our relationship with our planet. A.K.A. Earth is our home.
4)We are different and equal, we have different objectives but we still are a single species, with the same biological and emotional needs: food, water, shelter, human touch, life experiences, a purpose. A.K.A. humans right FTW.
5)We are part of an ecosystem. We are not THE species but ONE species. We can find a way to live in peace and harmony, compensating our needs with the others'. We can create an universal symbiosis. A.K.A. we need the Earth, but the Earth doesn't need us.
